# Math-414-Final-Project
Final [project](http://www.math.tamu.edu/~francis.narcowich/m414/s16/projects_s16.html),
using wavelets.
Demonstrating image compression, and the JPEG 2000.

---

## Instructions.
The report cannot be compiled until the images are installed.
The images are downloaded when [main.wl](https://github.com/TexAgg/Math-414-Final-Project/blob/master/main.wl) is run.
Then the pdf is compiled with the command `make` and cleaned with `make clean`.
